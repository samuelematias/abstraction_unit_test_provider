## About this app 🗣

This app was developed from the tutorial [Write 3X Better Unit Tests using Abstraction | Flutter Unit Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZW3Eb3J9s0&list=PLdTodMosi-BwEwlzjN6EyS1vwGXFo-UlK&index=13) by [Dane Mackier (Filledstacks)](https://www.filledstacks.com/).<br/><br/>
This app show how you can create unit test using abstraction (with provider) in Flutter.<br/>

> If you want to see how you can create unit test using abstraction with get_it instead provider, check this [repository](https://github.com/samuelematias/abstraction_unit_test_get_it).

## Attention 🚨

If you have problems when you use `SingleChildCloneableWidget` from provider, this widget was **deprecated**, so its necessary **replace** by this new widget, the `SingleChildWidget`.<br/><br/> More information about this changes, check this links:<br/>
